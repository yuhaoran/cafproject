\begin{abstract}
Cosmological large scale structure $N$-body simulations are computation-light,
memory-heavy problems in supercomputing. Traditional $N$-body simulation
algorithms use at least 24-byte memory per particle, of which six 4-byte single 
precision floating point numbers keep track phase space coordinates of each particle.
Here we present the algorithm and accuracy of a new parallel, memory-lite, Particle-
Mesh based $N$-body code, where each particle can occupy as low as 6-byte memory. This 
is accomplished by storing relative position and relative velocity of each particle, 
in the format of 1-byte-integer, respect to their averaged value of a mesh-grid. The 
remaining information is given by complimentary density and velocity fields, which are 
negligible in memory space, and proper ordering of particles, which gives no extra 
memory. Our numerical experiments show that this integer based $N$-body algorithm 
provides acceptable accuracy compared to traditional algorithm in cosmological 
simulations. This significant lowering of memory-to-computation ratio breaks the 
bottleneck of scaling up and speeding up large cosmological $N$-body simulations on 
multi-core and heterogenous computing systems.

\section{Introduction}\label{s.intro}
$N$-body simulation is a powerful tool to solve the highly nonlinear dynamic problems 
\citep{1988csup.book.....H}. It is widely used in cosmology to model the formation and 
evolution of the large scale structure (LSS). With the fast development of parallel 
supercomputers, we are able to simulate a system of more than a trillion ($10^{12}$) 
$N$-body particles. To date the largest $N$-body simulation in application is the 
``TianNu'' simulation \citep{2017NatAs...1E.143Y,2017RAA....17...85E} run on the 
TianHe-2 supercomputer by cosmological simulation code 
{\tt CUBEP3M} \citep{2013MNRAS.436..540H}. It uses nearly $3\times 10^{12}$ particles 
to simulate the cold dark matter (CDM) and cosmic neutrino evolution through the 
cosmic age.

The $N$-body simulations use considerable amount of memory, because the phase space 
coordinates $(x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z)$ of each $N$-body particle must be stored as, at 
least, six single precision floating point numbers (24 bytes). Contrarily, their 
computing workload can be alleviated by many algorithms, like Particle-Mesh [cite] and 
Tree [cite], scale as $o(N\log N)$ or even $o(N)$. On the other hand, modern 
supercomputer systems use multi cores, many integrated cores (MIC) and even densely 
parallelized GPUs, bringing orders of magnitude higher computing power, whereas these 
architectures usually have limited memory allocation. Thus, the computation-light but 
memory-heavy applications, compared to matrix multiplication and decomposition 
calculations, are less suitable for fully usage of the computing power of modern 
supercomputers. For example, although native and offload modes of {\tt CUBEP3M} are 
able to run on the Intel Xeon-PHI MIC architectures, with the require ment of enough 
memory, TianNu simulation were done on TianHe-2 with only its CPUs -- 73\% of the 
total memory but only 13\% of the total computing power.

We present a new $N$-body simulation code {\tt CUBE}, using as low as 6 byte
per particle (here after we use ``bpp'' referring to ``byte per particle'').
We show that it gives accurate results in cosmological LSS simulations.
The method is presented in \S\ref{s.method}, and a comparison between this method
and traditional method is shown in \S\ref{s.results}. Discussions and 
conclusions are in \S\ref{s.discussion}.

\section{Method}\label{s.method}
The most memory consuming part of a $N$-body simulation is usually the phase space 
coordinates of $N$-body particles -- 24 bpp (4 single precision floating numbers) must 
be used to store each particles' 3D position and velocity vectors. {\tt CUBEP3M}, an 
example of a memory-efficient parallel $N$-body code, can use as low as 40 bpp in 
sacrificing computing speed \citep{2013MNRAS.436..540H}. This includes the phase 
coordinates (24 bpp) for particles in physical domain and buffered region, a linked 
list (4 bpp), and a global coarse mesh and local fine mesh. 4-byte real numbers are 
not necessarily adequate in representing the {\it global} coordinates in simulations.
If the box size is many orders of magnitude larger than interactive distance
between particles, especially in the field of re-simulation of dense subregions,
double precision (8-byte) coordinates are needed to avoid truncation errors.
Another solution is to record {\it relative} coordinates for both position and velocity.
{\tt CUBE} replaces the coordinates and linked list 24+4=28 bpp memory usage
with an integer based storage, reduces the basic memory usage from 28 bpp down to
6 bpp, described as following \ref{ss.position} and \ref{ss.velocity}. The algorithm is described in \ref{ss.overview}.

\subsection{Particle position storage}\label{ss.position}
We construct a uniform mesh throughout the space and each particle belongs 
to its parent cell of the mesh. Instead of storing global coordinates of 
each particle, we store its offset relative to its parent cell which 
contains the particle. We divide the cell, in each dimension $d$, evenly into 
$2^8=256$ bins, and use a 1-byte (8 bits) integer $\chi_d \in \{-128,-127,...,127\}$ to 
indicate which bin it locates in this dimension. The global locations of 
particles are given by cell-ordered format in memory space, and a 
complimentary number count of particle number in this mesh (density field) 
will give complete information of particle distribution in the mesh. Then 
the global coordinate in $d$th dimension $x_d$ is given by $x_d=(n_c-1)+
(\chi_d+128+1/2)/256$, where $n_c=1,2,...,N_c$ 
is the index of the coarse grid. The mesh 
is chosen to be coarse enough such that the density field takes negligible 
memory. This coarse density field can be further compressed into 1-byte 
integer format, such that a 1-byte integer show the particle number in this 
coarse cell in range 0 to 255. In the densest cells (rarely happened) where 
there are $\ge 255$ particles, we can just write 255, and write the actual 
number as a 4-byte integer in another file.

In a simulation with volume $L^3$ and $N_c^3$ coarse cells, particle 
positions are stored with a precision of $L/(256N_c)$. The force calculation 
(e.g. softening length) should be configured much finer than this 
resolution, discussed in later sections. On the other hand, particle 
position can also be stored as 2-byte (16 bits) integers to increase the resolution. 
In this case, each coarse cell is divided into $2^{16}=65536$ bins and the 
position precision is $L/(65536N_c)$, precise enough compared to using
4-byte global coordinates, see later results. We denote this case ``x2'' and 
denote using 1-byte integers for positions ``x1''.

We collectively write the general position conversion formulae
\begin{equation}\label{eq.chi}
	\chi_d=\left[2^{8n_\chi}(x_d-\left[x_d\right])\right]-2^{8n_\chi-1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq.x}
	x_d=(n_c-1)+2^{-8n_\chi}\left(\chi_d+2^{8n_\chi-1}+1/2\right),
\end{equation}
where $[\ ]$ is the operator to take the integer part. $n_\chi\in\{1,2\}$ is the number of bytes used for each integer, $x_d$ and $\chi_d$ are floating and integer version of the coordinate. The velocity counterpart of them are $n_\nu=1,2$, $v_d$ and $\nu_d$. $n_c=1,2,...$ is the coarse grid index, given by the ordering of particles and a integer based particle density field (see \ref{sss.spatial_decomposition}). The position resolution for $n_\chi$-byte integer, ``x$n_\chi$'', is $2^{-8n_\chi}L/N_c$.

As a $n_\chi=1$, 1D ($d=1$), 4-coarse-cell ($N_c=4$) example, if $$\chi_1=(-128,127,0,60),$$ particle number density $${\rho_c^{\rm 1D}}=(1,0,2,1),$$ then in unit of coarse cells, $$x_1=(0.001953125, 2.998046875, 2.501953125, 3.736328125).$$

 \caption{\tcb{Xin, could you please check the units of both $y$-axis?}}
\label{fig.vdisp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Particle velocity storage}\label{ss.velocity}
Similarly, actual velocity in $d$th dimension $v_d$ is decomposed into an 
averaged velocity field on the same coarse grid $v_c$ and a residual $\Delta v$ 
relative to this field: 
\begin{equation}
	v_d=v_c+\Delta v.
\end{equation}
$v_c$ is always recorded and 
kept updated, and occupies negligible memory. We then divide velocity space 
$\Delta v$ into uneven bins, and use a $n_\nu$-byte integer to indicate
which $\Delta v$ bin the particle is located.

The reason why we use uneven bins is that, slower particles are more 
abundant compared to faster ones, and one should better resolve slower 
particles tracing at least linear evolution. On the other hand, there could 
be extreme scattering particles (in case of particle-particle force), and we 
can safely ignore or less resolve those nonphysical particles. One of the 
solution is that, if we know the probability distribution function (PDF) 
$f(\Delta v)$ we divide its cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(\Delta 
v)\in(0,1)$ into $2^{8n_\nu}$ bins to determine the boundary of $\Delta v$ 
bins, and particles should evenly distribute in the corresponding uneven $
\Delta v$ bins. Practically we find that either $f(v_d)$ or $f(\Delta v)$ is 
close to Gaussian, so we can use Gaussian CDF, or any convenient analytic 
functions which are close to Gaussian, to convert velocity between real 
numbers and integers.

The essential parameter of the velocity distribution is its variance. On 
non-linear scale, the velocity distribution function is non-Gaussian. 
However, to the first order approximation, we simply assume it as Gaussian 
and characterized by the variance
\begin{equation}\label{eq.vdisp}
	\tcb{ \sigma_v(a,k) = \frac{1}{3}  (a H f D)^2 \int_0^kd^3q\frac{P_{L}(q)}{q^2}},
\end{equation}
where $a(z)$ is the scale factor, $H(z)$ the Hubble parameter, $D$ is the 
linear growth factor, $f=d \ln D/d\ln a$, and $P_L(k)$ is the linear power 
spectrum of density contrast at redshift zero.
$\sigma_v(a,k)$ is a function of cosmic evolution $a$ and a smoothing scale 
$k$, or $r$ (see Figure \ref{fig.vdisp}). $\Delta v$
is the velocity dispersion relative to the coarse grid, so we approximate 
its variance as
\begin{equation}\label{eq.vdelta}
	\sigma^2_{\Delta}(a)=\sigma^2_v(a,r_c)-\sigma^2_v(a,r_p), 
\end{equation}
where $r_c$ is the scale of
coarse grid, and $r_p$ is the scale of average particle separation. In each
dimension of 3D velocity field, we use $\sigma^2_{\Delta}(a)/3$ according 
to the equipartition therorem. On different scales, we measure the 
statistics of $v_d$, $v_c$ and $\Delta v$ and find good agreement with the 
above model.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{fig_tile.pdf}
 \caption{Spacial decomposition in {\tt CUBE} in a 2D analogy. In this example, there are 2 images per dimension (${\tt nn}=2$), and 2 tiles per image per dimension (${\tt nnt}=2$). The orange boxes show the overlapped physical+buffer regions, inside of which one physical regions is indicated with green.}
\label{fig.tile}
\end{figure}

The simulation results are very insensitive if we manually tune the variance of the model $\sigma_\Delta$ within an order of magnitude. However, in $n_\nu=1$ case, the method of using uneven bins gets much better results than simply using equal bins between minimum and maximum values $[\min(\Delta v),\max(\Delta v)]$. So, one can safely use a standard $\Lambda$CDM (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant as dark energy) for slightly different cosmological models, in equation (\ref{eq.vdisp}). In {\tt CUBE}, the velocity conversion takes the formula
\begin{equation}\label{eq.nu}
	\nu_d=\left\lfloor(2^{8n_\nu}-1)\pi^{-1}\tan^{-1}\left((v_d-v_c)\sqrt{\pi/2\sigma_\Delta^2}\right)\right\rfloor,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq.v}
	v_d=v_c+\tan\left(\frac{\pi\nu_d}{2^{8n_\nu}-1}\right)\sqrt{2\sigma_\Delta^2/\pi},
\end{equation}
where $\lfloor\ \rfloor$ is the operator to take the nearest integer. 
Tangent functions are convenient and compute very fast. Compared to error 
functions used in Gaussian case, they take the same variance at $\nu_d=0$ but 
resolve high velocities relatively better.
Note again that proper choice of conversion formulae and $\sigma_\Delta$ 
only optimizes the velocity space sampling, but does not affect the physics. 

Initially, particles are generated by initial condition generator, at a higher redshift. The coarse grid density field $v_c$ is also generated at this step by averaging all particles in the coarse cell. A global $\sigma_\Delta$ is calculated by equation (\ref{eq.vdelta}), where linear approximation is hold. Then velocities are stored by equation (\ref{eq.nu}). During the simulation, $v_c$ is updated every time step, and a nonlinear $\sigma_\Delta$ is measured directly from the simulation, and can be simply used in the next time step, after scaled by the ratio of growth factors between two adjacent time steps. More details see section \ref{sss.algorithm}.

\subsection{Code overview}\label{ss.overview}
{\tt CUBE} uses a 2-level PM force calculation, same as {\tt CUBEP3M}, However, in order to apply the integer based format to the $N$-body simulation, substantial structural changes need to be done. {\tt CUBE} is written in Coarray Fortran, where Coarray features implement MPI communication between computation nodes/images\footnote{Images are the concept of computing nodes or MPI tasks in Coarray Fortran. We use this terminology in this paper.}.
The algorithm is described in this language. 

\subsubsection{Spacial decomposition}\label{sss.spatial_decomposition}
{\tt CUBE} uses cubic decomposition structures. The global simulation volume is decomposed into ${\tt nn}^3$ cubic sub-volumes, and each of these are assigned to a coarray {\it image}. Inside of an image, the sub-volume is further decomposed into ${\tt nnt}^3$ cubic {\it tiles}, which is a essential unit in the calculations. Each tile is surrounded by a {\it buffer} region which is ${\tt ncb}$ coarse cells thick. The buffer is designed for two reasons: (1) computing the fine mesh force, whose cut-off length ${\tt nforce\_cutoff}\leq{\tt ncb}$, and (2) collecting all possible particles travelling from a tile's buffer region to its center, {\it physical} region. Figure \ref{fig.tile} shows the spacial decomposition in a 2-dimensional analogy, with ${\tt nn=2}$ and ${\tt nnt=2}$. According to this spatial decomposition, and as discussed in the last two subsections, we declare $\{\rho_c,\chi_d,v_c,\nu_d\}$, or in variable expression $\{{\tt rho\_c},{\tt xp},{\tt vfield},{\tt vp}\}$ as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	&&{\tt integer(1)\ rho\_c(nex,nex,nex,nnt,nnt,nnt)[nn,nn,*]}\\
	&&{\tt integer(}n_\chi{\tt )\ xp(npmax)[nn,nn,*]}\\
	&&{\tt real(4)\ vfield(nex,nex,nex,nnt,nnt,nnt)[nn,nn,*]}\\
	&&{\tt integer(}n_\nu{\tt )\ vp(npmax)[nn,nn,*]}
\end{eqnarray*}
where ${\tt nex}={\tt nt}+2\times{\tt ncb}$ covers the buffer region on both sides, {\tt nnt} is the tile dimemsions, and {\tt nn} is the image {\it codimensions}\footnote{Coarray Fortran concept. Codimensions can do communications between images.}. We denote actual number of particles in a given image {\tt nplocal}, and ${\tt npmax}>{\tt nplocal}$ is a value large enough to store buffered particles and should take into account the fact that {\tt nplocal} on some images (with densely clustered structures) could be large. The particle position and velocity arrays {\tt xp} and {\tt vp} (equivalent to $\chi_d$ and $\nu_d$ in \ref{ss.position} and \ref{ss.velocity} respectively) are required to be sorted according to the same memory layout of {\tt rho\_c}, such that $n_c$ and thus global positions of particles $x_d$ can be obtained by equation (\ref{eq.x}). $\{{\tt rho\_c},{\tt xp},{\tt vfield},{\tt vp}\}$ provides a complete information of positions and velocities of particles, and we call it a snapshot, or checkpoint.


\subsubsection{Algorithm}\label{sss.algorithm}
Figure \ref{fig.code} shows the overall structure of the code and these subroutines are described in following paragraphs. 

{\tt initialize} and {\tt read\_particles} -- The subroutine {\tt initialize} creates necessary FFT plans and read in configuration files telling the program at which redshifts we need to do checkpoints, halofinds, or stop the simulation. Force kernels are also created or read in here. In {\tt read\_particles}, for each image, we read in all particles in {\it physical} regions of every tile (indicated in Figure \ref{fig.tile}), i.e., $\{{\tt rho\_c},{\tt xp},{\tt vfield},{\tt vp}\}$. These are obtained by the initial condition generator (see Appendix A). Because physical regions of tile are {\it complete} and {\it disjoint} in space, particles at this stage are also complete and disjoint. We call it ``disjoint state''. At this stage, {\tt rho\_c}'s buffer regions of each tile are 0, and the elements of {\tt xp} and {\tt vp} beyond physical number -- {\tt xp(nplocal+1:)} and {\tt vp(nplocal+1:)} can be arbitrary and are not used.

{\tt buffer\_density}, {\tt buffer\_x} and {\tt buffer\_v} -- In order to use the integer based format, {\tt xp} and {\tt vp} must always be ordered, and their number density field {\tt rho\_c} must always be present. In updating arrays of {\tt xp} and {\tt vp} (not simultaneously) of a local tile, a vicinity (buffer) region of the physical region is also needed. First, buffer regions of {\tt rho\_c} is synchronized between tiles and images by subroutine {\tt buffer\_density}. Then, by subroutines {\tt buffer\_x} and {\tt buffer\_v} respectively, {\tt xp} and {\tt vp} are updated to contain common, buffered particles, in an order according to the new, buffered {\tt rho\_c}. We call this stage ``buffered state''. After {\tt particle\_initialize} is done by all images (synchronized by a ``{\tt sync all}'', which is equivalent to a {\tt mpi\_barrier}), these three subroutines are called and particles are converted from disjoint state to buffered state.

      enddo
      call finalize
    end
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Overall structure of {\tt CUBE}.}
\label{fig.code}
\end{figure}


{\tt timestep} --
We operate a Runge-Kutta 2 method for time integration. i.e., we update position ($D$=drift) and velocity ($K$=kick) every half time step. For $n$ time steps, the operation would be $(DKKD)^n$ which is 2nd order accurate. The actual simulation applies varied time steps. In each iteration of the main loop, we firstly call {\tt timestep}, where a increment of time {\tt dt} is controlled by particles' maximum velocities, accelerations, cosmic expansion and any other desired conditions.

{\tt update\_xp} --
According to {\tt dt}, subroutine {\tt update\_xp} updates the positions of particles in a ``{\it gather}'' algorithm (in contrast, {\tt CUBEP3M} uses ``scatter'' algorithm) tile by tile. For each particle, {\tt xp} and {\tt vp} are converted to $x_d$ and $v_d$ by Equations(\ref{eq.x},\ref{eq.v}). Because each tile is in the buffered state with buffer depth {\tt ncb}, we are able to collect all possible particles whose $v_d\times{\tt dt}<{\tt ncb}$ from physical+buffer region to its physical region.

In order to keep particles ordered, for each tile, we first do $x_d=x_d+v_d\times{\tt dt}$ on all particles to obtain an updated density and velocity field on the tile, {\tt rho\_c\_new} and {\tt vfield\_new}. Then, this calculation in done on the same tile again\footnote{This repetition scales as $o(N)$ and is computational inexpensive.} to generate a new, local particle list {\tt xp\_new} and {\tt vp\_new} on the tile by Equations(\ref{eq.chi},\ref{eq.nu}). Here, the ordering of particles depends on {\tt rho\_c\_new}, and {\tt vfield\_new} is used as $v_c$ in Equation(\ref{eq.nu}). Then, another iteration is done on this tile to discard buffer regions of $\{{\tt rho\_c\_new},{\tt xp\_new},{\tt vfield\_new},{\tt vp\_new}\}$, converting buffer state to disjoint state, and it replaces corresponding part of $\{{\tt rho\_c},{\tt xp},{\tt vfield},{\tt vp}\}$. When all tiles are iterated, the entire image is in disjoint state, and {\tt nplocal} is updated. Then all images is synchronized by {\tt sync all} and we sum up {\tt nplocal} over images to check if total number of particles {\tt npglobal} is conserved.

{\tt update\_vp} -- 
After {\tt update\_xp}, or drift $D$, we call {\tt buffer\_density} and {\tt buffer\_xp} in order that particle positions are in buffered state, based on which, we update velocities (kick $K$) of particles in physical region of each tile. {\tt CUBE} uses a 2-level particle mesh scheme \citep{2013MNRAS.436..540H}. Local fine forces have a force cutoff ${\tt nforce\_cutoff}\leq{\tt ncb}$, i.e., $F_{\rm fine}(r>{\tt ncb})=0$. So, if we apply a fine-grid particle-mesh on an extended tile with buffered-depth {\tt ncb} (see Figure \ref{fig.tile} and regard it periodic), the force on physical regions does not depend on the false periodic boundary assumption, and the resulting fine force $F_{\rm fine}$ and velocity update on physical region is correct.

The compensating coarse grid force $F_{\rm coarse}$ is globally computed by using a coarser (usually by factor of 4) mesh by dimensional splitting -- a distributed-memory cubic decomposed 3D coarse density field is interpolated by particles, and we Fourier transform data in consecutive three dimensions with global transposition in between (known as the pencil decomposition). After the multiplication of force kernels, the inverse transform takes place to get the cubic distributed coarse force field $F_{\rm coarse}$, upon which velocities are updated again.

An optional particle-particle (PP) force $F_{\rm pp}$ can be called to increase the force resolution and the velocities are updated again. The collective operations of velocity update is Equation(\ref{eq.v}), $v_d=v_d+F_{\rm total}$ and Equation(\ref{eq.nu}).

The maximum accelerations $\max(\dot{v}_{\rm fine})$, $\max(\dot{v}_{\rm coarse})$, $\max(\dot{v}_{\rm pp})$ and maximum of velocities $\max(v_d)$ are collected controlling {\tt dt} for the {\tt timestep} in the next iteration. We also update $\sigma^2_{\Delta}$ according to the new $v_d-v_c$.

By far, {\tt vp} in physical regions are correctly updated. Remember that particle locations in the buffer regions has updated before {\tt PM} and remained unchanged. So we simply call {\tt buffer\_v} again such that the {\tt update\_x} in the next iteration will be done correctly. We call {\tt update\_vp} to convert {\tt vp} into buffered state.

{\tt checkpoint} -- 
If a desired redshift is reached, we execute the last drift step in the $(DKKD)^n$ operation by {\tt update\_xp}, and call {\tt checkpoint} to save the disjoint state of \{{\tt xp}, {\tt vp}, {\tt rho\_c}, {\tt vfield}\} on disk. Related operations, like run-time halo finder, projections are also done at this point. If final desired redshift is reached, {\tt final\_step} let us exit the main loop. These corresponding logical variables are controlled in {\tt timestep}.

{\tt finalize} --
Finally, in {\tt finalize} subroutine we destroy all the FFT plans and finish up any timing or statistics taken in the simulation.

\subsection{Memory layout}\label{ss.memory}
The memory overhead of fine force calculation is controlled by $(1/{\tt nnt})^3$. The memory usage of coarse arrays are negligible. 
Although {\tt xp\_new} and {\tt vp\_new} arrays take extra memory, they do not appear simultaneously for multiple tiles, and compared to {\tt xp} and {\tt vp}, the extra memory overhead is by a factor of $1/{\tt nnt}^3$.
Here we summarize the memory usage in unit of bpp (byte per particle).
